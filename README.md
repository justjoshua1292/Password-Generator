# Password-Generator
Assignment 3 - Password Generator

For this assignment, we were called to modify a starter code provided to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. The app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that was written by me. The application is supposed to have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
The password will include special characters.

Once the Password generator is ran to perfection, you will be given a random password of your choosing featuring a number, special character, uppercase and lowercase letters if you decide or any combination of the choices.

You can do this by clicking the button on the screen! Try it out!
