# Password-Generator
Assignment 3 - Password Generator

For this assignment, we were called to modify a starter code provided to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. The app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that was written by me. The application is supposed to have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
The password will include special characters.

Once the Password generator is ran to perfection, there should be no console errors & you'll be given a random password of your choosing featuring a number, special character, uppercase and lowercase letters if you decide or any combination of the choices.

You can do this by clicking the button on the screen! Try it out! ðŸ˜Žâœ¨ðŸ˜Š
